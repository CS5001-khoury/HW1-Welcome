# Homework 1: Welcome to CS5001

First before you start this homework assignment, make sure you compete the syllabus quiz! You won't be able to turn in this homework until you score a 4 of 4 on the quiz. Now let's start. Part of this homework will be autograded and parts will be graded via TAs. You will have four points possible for this assignment, each corresponding to a Tier Mastery category (see the syllabus!)



## Warm-up: Star Rating App

For this assignment, you will want to use the provided template file called [star_rating.py](star_rating.py). The file does have errors in it, but you should be able to load it fine into IDLE. If you run the file without changes, it should output the following:

```text
1 star rating: 
2 star rating:
3 star rating:
3 star rating:
3 star rating:


My star rating is
Help on function five_star in module __main__:

five_star()
    sets five * to the variable stars.
```

The final solution output should look like

```text
1 star rating: *
2 star rating: **
3 star rating: ***
4 star rating: ****
5 star rating: *****


My star rating is *****


Help on function five_star in module __main__:

five_star()
    sets five * to the variable stars.
```

### Let's get started

First you will see a lot of `functions` in the code. While we will cover these later in the course, we separated the warmup into these function, so you can think of your code in 'blocks' doing one thing at a time. 
> Always make sure to read through all provided code, and express what it does in your own words.  
>     Pros use comments in the code to do that, and not sure yet is  a valid answer!)

**Your Tasks**  
1. You should change each function to set the correct number of stars to the variable `stars` 
   * You don't need to modify anything else, just that one line!
   * You should use the string multiplication operator (review the lecture on concatenation)
2. Find the errors in the print out in the main function, fix them
   * Don't forget the two missing lines
